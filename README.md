# ChipKrypt Front End

Welcome to my front-end repo for ChipKrypt.

## Styling
- Different CSS files for each component. 
- `App.css` is basically global styles.
- typewriter effect has become consistent in all my projects at this point, added it for aesthetics.
- styling for price tracker doesn't want to work at the current moment. Looking for a work around. 

## Some Guides I used for assistance. 
login and navigation. These videos were lifesavers:
- [Getting Started with Firebase Auth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjXzJ2wVs5g)
- [React and Firebase](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vv_Oi7zPPTw)
- [Integrating Firebase with React](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unr4s3jd9qA)

## Known Bugs 
- HomePage.js was tricky to make the authentication for logged in users only. Working on fixing this.
- Coin duplication glitch. You can have more than one of the same coin listed on the homepage favorites. Need to add a function to check if the coin is already lsited on the homepage.

## Want To Run This Locally?
1. Clone the repo.
2. `npm install` to get all the needed packages.
3. `npm start` and then you should see it on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Future Edits
- Gonna make the login functionality better to use. Still getting used to it.
- Planning to add more interactive bits to the UI.
