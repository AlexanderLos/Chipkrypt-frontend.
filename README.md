Welcome to the front-end of ChipKrypt! 

**Notes**
Styling was done in seperate files to maintain easier tracking, 
App.css works globally for those css files so kept font ID in there.

I love the typewriter effect, you know I had to add it where I could. Will experiment with more
libraries for animations in later commits.

Login page alongside the NAV/LOGIN&LOGOUT alongside some styling for it was borrowed online
functions were not entirely my own code, 
used a ton of outside resources to assist with setting that up. Some links that helped below.

**Known Bugs**
The homepage and price tracker was setup in a way so unless you are logged in you cannot access them, the problem is you can
access the HomePage.js. This issue cost me alot of time so I ignored it for now, will return to fix it in later commits.

**Notes**
For setting up the backend I used a mix of previous lectures and new YT vids 
Firebase was a new concept for me so outside resources helped a ton.
